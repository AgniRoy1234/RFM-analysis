# RFM-analysis

RFM analysis is an important concept in marketing. It can be used for targeted marketing by identifying which customers are frequent and recent buyers and contribute relatively big in terms of monetory value.
When we are targetting customers to make them buy more, we should be careful that we are targetting the right customers. Out efforts wont give fruitful results if we target wrong segments of people. 
In RFM analysis, customers are identified based on the number of transactions they have done, the sum(or average) amount of money they have contributed via their transactions, and the intervals between the day of analysis(or some relevant day) and the day of their last visit. Based on that they are assigned proper scores. The customers with high scores are given more importance while customers with low scores can be neglected.

**#About the dataset**

Here we have almost 10 years of data which shows the transactions in a stationary and gifts store. Each row corresponds to a transactions which has 3 columns-the customer id, the amount involved in transaction and the date of transaction. The data is in text format so we had to use necessary steps to convert it to a relevant dataframe which could be used for analysis. 
The language used here is Python and we have used Jupyter Notebook.
